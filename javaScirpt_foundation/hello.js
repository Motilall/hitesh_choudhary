console.log("Hello Chai!");

// how javascript executes the code(behind the scene)
// 1> source file               |
// 2> parse (tockenization, collect keywords from source code)     | all these three steps happend  even before the code runs (it will happen as soon as i give code to the editor)
// 3> creation of syntax tree   |

// 4> code given to JIT compiler
// 5> converted into byte code
// 6> converted into machine code
// 7> code exection

//(primary purpose syntax tree in javascript code execution?)
